  "description": "In the fiction of the *Starforged* setting, those who swear vows are the Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself, as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise to someone else. Some vows might be made grudginglyâ€”out of duty, necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.\n\nMake these **quest moves** when you swear vows, make progress on your quests, and resolve vows.",
