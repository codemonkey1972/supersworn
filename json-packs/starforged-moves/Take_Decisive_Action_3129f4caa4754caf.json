If any objectives remain and the fight continues, you are in control.\n\nOn a **weak hit**, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.\n\nRoll   | Result\n-------|--------\n1-40   | It’s worse than you thought: Make a suffer move (-2)\n41-52  | Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears\n53-64  | You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged, or broken\n65-76  | Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost\n77-88  | Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance\n89-100 | It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective is revealed\n\nOn a **miss**, you are defeated or your objective is lost. @Compendium[foundry-supersworn.starforgedmoves.78baa51694fe37c5]{Pay the Price}.",
