You may immediately mark up to half their earned progress (round down) on this quest.\n  * Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character's connections, and envision how time or circumstances have changed them in a dramatic way. When you @Compendium[foundry-supersworn.starforgedmoves.05909d6310d209a6]{Make a Connection} with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.\n  * Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.\n\nFor each **miss**, choose one.\n\n  * Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former character's foes has gained power or influence.\n  * Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your former character's beliefs, goals, or allegiances.\n  * Open Pandora's Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.",
