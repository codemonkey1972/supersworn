  "description": "History is often chronicled through objects of power. Wars and accords, struggles and triumphs, love and hate, sacrifice and deathâ€”these legacies can imbue objects with cultural importance and supernatural gifts.\n\nIn **Ironsworn**, these items are called *rarities*. They may be handed down through generations, lost or hidden away in the depths of perilous sites, coveted by powerful forces, or forgotten and discarded. When you obtain a rarity through the course of your story, you gain a subtle but lasting impact on your character and their abilities.",
