They can be shared with allies, but only if it's practical for them to make use of it (not everyone may know how to use a RESEARCH LAB).\n\nWhen you [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) and score a miss, you can mark a module as broken to offset further danger for your STARSHIP. Flip the card over to indicate its broken state. A broken module cannot be used until you successfully [Repair](Starforged/Moves/Recover/Repair) it.",
