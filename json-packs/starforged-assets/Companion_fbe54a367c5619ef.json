When you gain a companion, give them a name and envision their look and personality.\n\nCompanions utilize a health meter that can be reduced if an outcome puts them in harm's way. When your companion faces harm, make the [Companion Takes a Hit](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Companion_Takes_a_Hit) move. When their health is at 0, they are in danger of being killed or destroyed.",
