If you are playing with others, this is a shared asset; each of you may use the STARSHIP's abilities while aboard the craft.\n\nThe command vehicle has an integrity meter and starts at 5 integrity. When your STARSHIP takes a hit, make the [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) move to see what happens.",
