  "description": "**Support vehicles** complement your command vehicle for planetside or short-range operations. If you are playing with others, one of you might serve as the pilot or owner of a support vehicle, but anyone on board can use its abilities as appropriate to the situation.\n\nAs with the command vehicle, your support vehicles have integrity meters. The maximum integrity varies based on the type of vehicle. When a support vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment, you must [Withstand Damage](Starforged/Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) to see how it fares.",
